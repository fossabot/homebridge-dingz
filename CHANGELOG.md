## [1.2.1] - 2020-05-17
**Breaking change**: This release breaks existing configs. 

After upgrading to this version, you have to remove the plugin config block from your config, restart Homebridge, add the plugin config again and restart Homebridge once more to apply the fix. Otherwise you will end up with spurious old Lightbulbs in your setup.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-05-14

This plugin implements some (but not all) functions of [Dingz](https://dingz.ch) Smart Home Devices. The plugin also supports (some) myStrom Devices as they share much of the same API definitions and concepts with Dingz.

The plugin attempts to

- auto-discover devices, and to
- auto-identify dingz settings and thus accessories by using device type, dip switch settings and input configuration

The following Dingz services are implemented:

- Dimmers (LightBulb) 
- Shades (Blinds)
- Room temperature
- Motion sensor status (polling only, only for Dingz+ models)

Not (yet) implemented:

- Front LED (LightBulb)
- Buttons (StatefulProgrammableSwitch)
- Thermostat (Temperature)
- Motion sensor webhook (push mode instead of polling)
