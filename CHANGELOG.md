## [v1.0.0] - 2020-05-14

This plugin implements some (but not all) functions of [Dingz](https://dingz.ch) Smart Home Devices. The plugin also supports (some) myStrom Devices as they share much of the same API definitions and concepts with Dingz.

The plugin attempts to

- auto-discover devices, and to
- auto-identify dingz settings and thus accessories by using device type, dip switch settings and input configuration

The following Dingz services are implemented:

- Dimmers (LightBulb) 
- Shades (Blinds)
- Room temperature
- Motion sensor status (polling only, only for Dingz+ models)

Not (yet) implemented:

- Front LED (LightBulb)
- Buttons (StatefulProgrammableSwitch)
- Thermostat (Temperature)
- Motion sensor webhook (push mode instead of polling)
